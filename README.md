## Description
This workout tracker application will allow users to create and track their daily workouts as we could all use a little reminder to stay on track! Users can log multiple exercises per workout, tracking each exercise's name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration. For cardio workouts, users can track the distance travelled for consistency and self-betterment.
